# The Nox Framework

Nox is a simple, lightweight and efficient front-end framework. The point of this framework is to be light weight, beautiful and functional. To achieve this, we don't want to or need to reinvent the wheel, thus, some things are borrowed.

# How to use the files
Using nox is simple. You can read how to do so [at the docs](https://get-nox.com/docs).
